# heads_up_holdem
Basic Usage:
'ruby holdem.rb'
Will initialize the 2 players with chipstacks a new instance of the Board class to allow a single 'hand' of poker to be played.
Play should continue until one of the players chipstack reaches 0.

Known issues:
Lacks error checking
Player input must be entered exactly
Players must not bet more than they have (needs to be checked)
Preflop - bb 'option', when the small blind simply calls and the bb can choose to check or raise, incorrectly displays the word 'bet'

Thank you to the creator of the 'ruby-poker' gem, Robolson, which is utilized to check hand strengths against eachother.
